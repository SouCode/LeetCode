/* Usage Case: Database query with multiple filters
you have a data driven application that interacts with a database, as part of the application
you need to perform queries that involve filtering data based on multiple conditions or criteria.

1. Data retrieval: Store the data from the database and store it in an array representing the database
2. filter the conditions: define the conditions as another array
3. Intersection: Use the intersection of the two arrays to find the common elements that satisfy
all filter conditions.
4Â Results: the resulting array after taking the intersection contains the filtered database.
